<p>Zimbabwe was the first country to issue a 100 Trillion dollar bill. I have ten which makes me a Quadrillionaire:</p>

<p>Each bill is about 15 x 7.5 centimeters so 112.5 sq centimeters. That’s 1.12500 × 10 16 square nanometers (NM). The diameter of a gold atom is .288 nanometers so it would take 3.90625 x 10 18 gold atoms to cover the bill. 1 trillion is 1x1012. Each bill is worth 100 trillion dollars - 1x1014 dollars which doesn’t give us enough quite enough dollars to equal the number of atoms required to cover the bill.</p>

<p>If we go strictly based on size and attempt to cover the bill with gold atoms a single atom thick, Zimbabwe is the first country to ever use a standard where each of their dollars is worth 40000 atoms of gold. 1 gram of gold is about 3x1021 atoms.</p>

<p>Now don’t I feel rich.</p>
