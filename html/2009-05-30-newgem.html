<p>Iâ€™ve been using newgem to build Babelphish (translation helper thing). The <a href="http://newgem.rubyforge.org/">docs from the ruby forge site</a> are a bit out of date. If you use newgem to build anything <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/10/31/newgem-100-all-thanks-to-cucumber/">be sure to look at this post from Dr Nic</a> and pay attention to the options you can pass in. In particular I noticed that the instructions on the rubyforge site indicate the gem will build a default website. If you want to do that you need to pass in the -w option.</p>
