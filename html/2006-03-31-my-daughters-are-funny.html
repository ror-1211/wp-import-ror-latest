<p>I went to a meeting at MIT with Wiley last week. When I am gone I
make a point to call my wife every night because I miss her. She
tells me that while eating dinner my youngest daughter (2 years) Jeann
points to Alyssa (4 years) and says, “*<strong>| head.” My wife is of
course appauled and says, “What!!!” So Jenna points to Alyssa
again and says, “Alyssa, *</strong>| head.” My wife again says
“What!!!!!!!” Jenna slows down this time and says, “Alyssa,
sh.i..r..t head.” Kids are funny.</p>
