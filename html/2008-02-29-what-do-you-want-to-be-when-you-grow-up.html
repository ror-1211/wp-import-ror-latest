<p>My Nephew’s preschool class recent took a field trip to a local store. They went to the bakery and saw the big mixers and how donuts are made. They toured the meat section where they had some interesting machines and I am sure the rest of the store. Gadgets have an effect on guys at any age.</p>

<p>When he got home Owen said, “when I grow up I want to wrap meat.” I guess the meat wrapper was the highlight of the trip.</p>
