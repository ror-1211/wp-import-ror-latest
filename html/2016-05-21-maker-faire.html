<p>After a week with the Google tech elite today was a day dedicated to fun, curiosity and fascination. Callie brought Devin down Yesterday so we could spend today experiencing the inventions of the Bay Area’s eccentric, creative, technology minds.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to describe Maker Faire. There are vendors selling everything from small CNC machines to youth groups with kits. There were more 3D printers than I could count including one about 20 feet tall that could print some truely monumental sculptures.</p>

<p>There were classes on how to grow from mushrooms and a truck converted into a mobile green house. There were sculptures that spewed fire, a Tesla with panels that lit up like a zebra and a giant forest of lit up inflatable astro-flower things. It was pretty cool.</p>

<p>How about a Lego machine that folds paper airplanes and then launches them? There’s Devin standing in front a giant sculpture made of tape and a T-Rex made of cardboard covered in EL-Wire.</p>

<p>Oh and there was also free Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Any event with free ice cream is a bit of awesome.</p>
