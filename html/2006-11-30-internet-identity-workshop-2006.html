<p>I and Trent are headed to the Internet Identity Workshop this next week. This is one of those hard to figure out areas that is becoming more and more important. We hope to have some kind of solution in place with Ozmozr within the next year or so. Hopefully, this workshop will help us nail down what it is that we are going to do.
A few weeks ago I attended the Web 2.0 Summit. Yahoo talked about opening their authentication to the world and since then I have seen a few people using that. They have half a billion registered users. That might mean they win the identity game with numbers.
At least it will be warmer in San Francisco. It has been around 12-20 degrees here.</p>
