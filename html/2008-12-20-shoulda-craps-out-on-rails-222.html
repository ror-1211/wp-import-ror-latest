<p>I tried the latest shoulda on luvfoo a while back and it died on the internationalization stuff so we gave up. Turns out that <a href="http://gusg.us/code/ruby/rails-2_2-headaches-1">with the new internationalization in Rails 2.2.2 shoulda is dying again.</a> I know the code is free and shoulda really is a great project, but I think this shows why you have to be very careful about what 3rd party projects you include in your software. All of us using shoulda are now in a holding pattern until we get an update.</p>
