<p>One of the most difficult tasks when putting up a new site is picking the right host. Moving hosts later on is terribly difficult so choosing the correct hosting company is as important as selecting a business partner. <a href="http://del.icio.us/jbasdf/hosting">I’ve collected about 30 hosting companies in my delicious bookmarks</a>. Some are specific to a platform others are really cheap. I recorded them because they looked interesting.</p>

<p>The latest movement in web hosting is towards cloud hosting. This is the holy grail for the user and for the hosting company. Imagine a web host that scales as you grow. Everyone would love nothing more than a host that could handle getting slammed by Digg.</p>

<p>Amazon’s ec2 service offers scalable services, but it is not a simple as your typical web hosting company. <a href="http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/">The Ruby gem ec2onrails</a> will simplify the process of getting your Ruby on Rails application up an running. <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/m/">RightScale</a> builds on ec2 to make it easy to deploy your application. They add a dashboard and make it easy to load balance and bring up new instances. However, at a starting price of $500 a month and a $2500 setup fee they aren’t cheap. <a href="http://www.elastra.com/">Elastra</a> is another cloud computing service. They claim to not have setup fees, but I can’t find a price on their site. The real advantage to these services beyond scaling really needs to be cost. Paying for what you use can be great, but can also be a bit scary. If you site takes off all of a sudden you might get stuck with a rather large bill, but hey at least your server didn’t go down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mosso.com/">Mosso</a> has the ability to let you host linux or windows. At $100 a month their price is reasonable and they can scale up depending on how many requests you make. <a href="http://www.3tera.com/">3Tera</a> claims they can ‘scale from a fraction of a server to hundreds of CPUs in days’. They also claim that you won’t need to change your application code.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost.com</a> hosting space ($6-$7) isn’t going away anytime soon. However, the future of scalable applications I think lies with cloud computing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://eedious.blogspot.com/">Alain Benedict</a> I am adding <a href="http://morphexchange.com/">Morph</a> to the list of services. I haven’t had time to really examine the service yet, but it looks like it removes a lot of the hassle of hosting a Rails application.</p>
