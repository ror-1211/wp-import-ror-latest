<p>I am one of the owner’s of <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">ThePlanCollection.com an online home plan publisher</a>. When you write all the code that powers a site like that you become very familiar with the product. <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com/house-plans/home-plan-3503">This is one of my favorite house plans of all time.</a> It’s not huge, but it isn’t small either. I think the style is classic. Maybe it is the picture that I love, but I really wish more homes were built with this sort of timeless style.</p>
