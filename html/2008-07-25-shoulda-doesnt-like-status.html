<p>One of the models in a project I am working on right now ends in ‘status’.  Rails handles that just find but in my tests I started noticing an odd error:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
test: Lookup should belong_to lookup_status. (LookupTest):
NameError: uninitialized constant LookupStatu
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

The Shoulda test looks like this:
<pre><code class="ruby">
   should_belong_to :lookup_status
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

Nothing to complicated there.  Should recognizes the relationship just find but when it tries to find a class it goes looking for LookupStatu.  I fixed this by adding the the class name to the relationship thus:

<pre><code class="ruby">
belongs_to :lookup_status, :class_name =&gt; 'LookupStatus'
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>
</pre></pre></pre>
