  We've had the privilege of working with <a href="http://www.instructure.com">Instructure</a> for many years <a href="https://www.atomicjolt.com/our-work.html">building LTI tools and integrating</a> with the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">Canvas API</a>. <a href="http://www.atomicjolt.com">Atomic Jolt</a> has been a Canvas Alliance Partner for a number of years which means that we work closely with development teams at Instructure, build <a href="https://products.atomicjolt.com/">cool products to enhance Canvas</a> and we go to Instructure's conferences. We've been at <a href="https://www.canvaslms.com/news/instructurecon/">InstructureCon</a> the past few years, and we've finally started sponsoring the regional CanvasCon conferences. That gave me the opportunity this week to join Canvas users and partners in Miami at <a href="https://www.fiu.edu/">Florida International University</a> to show of our products:

  One of my favorite parts of any Instructure conference is the location. Virginia Key to the East of Miami offers paddleboarding and mountain biking. It's tough but someone has to visit these places.
