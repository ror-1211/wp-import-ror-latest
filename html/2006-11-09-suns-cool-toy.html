<p>Sun labs is showing a project called sunspot. It is awesome. It is a tiny platform that lets you use Java to control a microcontroller that has all kinds of built in sensors. It is like a lego mindstorm for geekier people.</p>

<p>Go to to get one:
sunspotworld.com</p>

<p>A sunspot will cost $500. This is the most awesome toy you can buy a geek this Christmas.</p>
