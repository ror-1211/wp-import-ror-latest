<p>One frequent conversation amongst engineers entails the bragging of how
hard their undergrad education was.  This is usually measured by
two factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How poorly the class performed overall</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How late one stayed in the computer labs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My dad always told me that your educational experience would reflect
the job environment in the real world.  It’s almost 11 pm
now.  We are still working.  I am sitting in a “lab” in a
building on campus.  As I look out the window I see students in
various states of exhaustion.  I remember my days in the labs, the
days I use for bragging rights, and I have to laugh at dad’s
prophecy.  My education and my job match almost perfectly. 
The only difference is that the lab has shifted a couple hundred yards
to the northwest from the engineering to the education building. 
eduCommons 1.5.2 is almost ready.  Really dear, I will be home
soon.</p>
