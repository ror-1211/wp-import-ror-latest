<p>I started running into a few issues on an Engineyard Solo instance with my muck gems. Basically, <a href="http://github.com/jbasdf/muck/tree/master">muck</a> consists of a lot of
Rails engines packaged as gems for reusability. When we release a new app we also need to release new versions of the gems since
thatâ€™s where most of guts of the lives. This worked fine until recently when we rebuilt our instance (to switch to <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>).
In the past a wait of about ten minutes was sufficient for the new gems to show up. The problem was that I would do a sudo gem
install muck-engine and no matter how much cussing I did I ended up with the old version not the new one that I just released.
I checked gem env and http://gems.rubyforge.org was listed as a source. Thanks to <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra</a> I found out that Engineyard
maps http://gems.rubyforge.org to a local mirror. If you want to change it just edit /etc/hosts and comment out the
line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>174.129.222.219  gems.rubyforge.org
</code></pre>

<p>All better again.</p>
