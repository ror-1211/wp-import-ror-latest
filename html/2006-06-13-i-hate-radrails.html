<p>As per my last post I am loving Ruby on Rails. The biggest drawback to the framwork is my quest to find the right editor.
I have actually been using Dreamweaver when I write code on Windows. It makes me feel like a lesser programmer for some reason,
but it works great. There is a plugin called <a href="http://www.ridingtheclutch.com/">RubyWeaver</a> that makes it easy. Add into that the Subversion utility for
Dreamweaver that lets you <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm#view=sn106&amp;viewName=Exchange Search Details&amp;loc=en_us&amp;authorid=0&amp;page=0&amp;scrollPos=0&amp;subcatid=0&amp;snid=sn106&amp;itemnumber=-1&amp;extid=1018603&amp;catid=0">cloak/uncloak SCM Directories</a> and you have a decent editor.
(Without that last extension Dreamweaver will try to upload all the hidden Subversion directories and make a mess of you server).</p>

<p>On Linux I have been using <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a>. It is ok most of the time. However, every now and then it drives me nuts.
Today is such a day. When I copy and paste I get randon ‘invalid argument’ errors. I can live with that but the latest is insane.
As I type, Radrails is outputing everything in reverse. No kidding. Here is some output:
