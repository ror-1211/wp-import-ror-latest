<p>We are looking at implementing OpenID in the Folksemantic applications at <a href="http://cosl.usu.edu">COSL</a>. I have been trying to figure out how to present this new technology to our users. Most people have been adding OpenID alongside their standard navigation. <a href="http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/openidauthentication">DHHâ€™s plugin uses http:// to indicate OpenID using your current login form. </a> The password field disappears once the page notices that you are using http://</p>

<p><a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/signin">I think I like the magnolia is doing it</a>. They make it clear that you are using OpenID and makes a quick case for signing up for an OpenID.</p>
