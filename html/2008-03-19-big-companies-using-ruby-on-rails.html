<p>I am frequently asked how reliable/scalable is Ruby on Rails? I usually tell people about <a href="http://twitter.com//">Twitter</a>or more recently point them to <a href="http://highscalability.com/friends-sale-architecture-300-million-page-view-month-facebook-ror-app">this article about the Friendâ€™s For Sale Facebook application</a>. The answer is, yes Rails scales just fine. The trick is getting your database to scale.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/03/big-name-compan.html">Obie Fernandez, a major name in the Rails community put together a list of the big companies that are using Rails</a>.</p>

<p>Here are two of the places to look for the big Rails deployments:
<a href="http://rails100.pbwiki.com/">http://rails100.pbwiki.com/</a>
<a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/high-profile-organisations">http://www.workingwithrails.com/high-profile-organisations</a>.</p>

<p>The elegant, framework that lets developers enjoy their job once again is scalable and will work for you application. I love Ruby on Rails.</p>
