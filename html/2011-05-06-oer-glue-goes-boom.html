<p>We’ve been building OER Glue since this last July and the result is a piece of technology that when people see it they have the same reaction they have during a magic show - HOLY SH@#$ how do you do that?</p>

<p>We think it’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>Beyond pretty cool we feel like it’s an idea that can have a significant impact on online education. OER Glue makes it simple to find and then remix Open Education Resources with popular services. <a href="http://www.oerglue.com/">You can get a beta code here</a>.</p>

<p>Our big news for the day is that we have been selected to join the <a href="http://www.boomstartup.com/">BoomStartup</a> program for the summer. We are extremely excited for the opportunity and feel that the experience will help us bring the technology and subsequently a new kind of learning experience to learners world wide.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of links with the announcement:</p>
