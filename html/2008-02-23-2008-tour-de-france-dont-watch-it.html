<p>As long as I am ranting about everything under the sun I may as well add the Tour de France to the list. This year they have banned Team Astana from participating. The result of this action is that Alberto Contador and Levi Leipheimer, last years 1st and 3rd place finishers won’t be in the peloton.</p>

<p>People have enough reasons to not watch Le Tour these days, but this action might just be the one that drives fans back on their bikes and away from the TV in July (not a bad thing).</p>
