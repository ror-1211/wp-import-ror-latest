<p>Marion told me that he rented ‘Enchanted’ for his kids from Blockbuster.com. Now in all his friend’s feeds it says ‘Marion rented Enchanted’. Maybe I am not truly social yet, but this activity makes Facebook into that really annoying neighbor who spies on you and then spreads neighborhood gossip. Time to butt out. They hide the functionality that turns off this annoying behavior, but <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=feeds&amp;tab=external">here’s a link to turn off integration with external websites</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=feeds&amp;tab=ads">here’s one to turn off social ads</a>. If I want to rent ‘Where The Red Fern Grows’ for a cry it is not of your damn business. Good riddance.</p>
