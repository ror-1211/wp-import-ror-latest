<p>I can’t resist new stuff so I’m updating Genlighten to Rails 2.3.2.  This release comes with some pretty sweet additions like Rack.  Here’s what I had to do:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.3.2' (easy)</li>
	<li>Removed stuff like this from my code:
          <pre><code class="ruby">
            protect_from_forgery :except =&gt; :swfupload
            session :cookie_only =&gt; false, :only =&gt; :swfupload
          &lt;/pre&gt;</code>
          -- 'The :digest and :secret options to protect_from_forgery are deprecated and have no effect.' and sessions are lazy loaded now.&lt;/li&gt;
	<li>I updated shoulda to the latest version.  This resulted in a number of deprecation warnings which took me a while to fix.</li>

&lt;/ol&gt;

</pre></li></ol>
