<p>I am in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruby-fs-api/">Ruby-fs API</a> presentation now.  Funding for the library came from USFamilyTree.com.</p>

<p>It is REST based.</p>

<p>Data model is:
Person
Person has many Assertions
Assertion has one Contributor, Citation(not yet implemented), Note</p>

<p>Each person has a lot of data associated with them so you don’t want to be parsing xml data on the fly.</p>

<p>Include the library with this:
require ‘family_tree_api/client’</p>

<p>The library will handle turning all the data into objects for you.  This makes access to the API slick.  I love ruby.
ie</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
person = client.summary_person 'KW3B-2L7', descendants =&gt; 2
mother = person.mother
grandmother = person.mother.mother
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

<pre><code class="ruby">
search_params = {:givenName =&gt; 'Parker', :familyName =&gt; 'Flech'}
results = client.search search_params
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

As with all things Ruby this API makes it very easy to talk to FamilySearch.  If you are in the genealogy space and know Ruby give it a try.

The good news is that they are open to patches.  The project is in active development.  They will be creating a plugin for Rails.  Right now he just checks out the code to his lib directory.
