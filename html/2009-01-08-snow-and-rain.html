<p>I just manged to get the kids in bed. It’s 9:00pm. I started at 6:30. I’m sitting here watching the rain letting my brain idle for a few moments until I get back into write code.</p>

<p>It’s a bit odd that its raining given that it is January. Over the Christmas break we received treacherous amounts of snow. Maybe it was like this when I was a kid and I just don’t remember, but it sure seems like the weather various a lot more these days.</p>

<p>I don’t really mind. I don’t love the cold. Christmas is over spring can come.</p>
