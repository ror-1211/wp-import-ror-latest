<p>We refactored <a href="http://www.oerglue.com" title="OER Glue">OERGlue</a> to use <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/" title="Backbone.js">backbone.js</a>. That makes our life a lot simpler. Along the way we discovered <a href="http://requirejs.org/" title="Require.js">require.js</a> and I entered nerdvana. The documentation for require.js and backbone.js are both good and it doesn’t take to long to read through the code. However, putting them together, getting the development environment right and then deploying can be a bit of a challenge.</p>

In hopes that my experience will help someone else get started I’ve put together an example application that contains the basics that you need to get started:</p>
