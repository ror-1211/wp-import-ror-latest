<p>This is sad news for Utahns. <a href="http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695254897,00.html">Snelgrove ice cream is going away</a>. When I was a kid I always loved caramel cashew. My grandfather used to buy it on their trips to Salt Lake City and carry it home in an ice chest with dry ice in it. They have been around for 79 years, but were bought out in 1990 by Dreyers. The sales volume of Snelgroves compared to Dreyers is too low for them to justify continuing the brand. This is truly a sad day.</p>
