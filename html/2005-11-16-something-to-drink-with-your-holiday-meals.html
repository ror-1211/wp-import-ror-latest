<p>I am not sure how many years <a href="http://www.jonessoda.com/files_new/turkey05.html">Jones soda has been doing this, but for a
limited time during the holiday season you can get a variety of
drinks</a>.  Brussels Sprout with Prosciutto, Cranberry Sauce, Turkey &amp; Gravy, Wild Herb Stuffing,
and Pumpkin Pie are all included in their national pack.  There is
a regional pack available in limited areas that comes with smoked salmon pate.  Enjoy.</p>
