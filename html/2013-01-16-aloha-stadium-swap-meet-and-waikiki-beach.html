<p>Saturday and Sunday there’s a flea market at Aloha Stadium. We chose to visit Saturday. It’s a great place to buy souvenirs to bring home. As you walk around the stadium there’s a continual repeat of booths selling bags, jewelery, board shorts and bikinis, but scattered amongst the repeats are a few gems. I found a place selling balsamic vinegars flavored with tropical fruits. I ended up picking up a coconut, pineapple and passion fruit flavored vinegar the collection of which put us 7 lbs over weight on our suit case and would have cost $135 bucks to get home. Luckily, the airline provides boxes. You can simply pull out the extra and throw it in a box and pay $25. That’s a good thing to know.</p>

<p>Here’s Callie excited about the flea market:</p>

<p>We spent the later part of the day at Waikiki beach. It’s spectacular, and it was fun to go once, but it is crazy busy and covered with people. All the hotels in the area dump their inhabitants on the beach each day. There were a hundred people on the water trying to surf and thousands of people lying in the beach.</p>

<p>This is us at Wakiki. A lot of guys at the beach shaved their chests. I pushed for a new anti-shaving trend.</p>

<p>We ended the day with a surfing dog</p>

<p>He was really pretty good (way better than me) and seemed to enjoy himself.
We finished the day trying to find Yakiniku for dinner, but ended up at Chilli’s. The lady who sat us was super nice and brought all us dehydrated tourists water. The guy who served us knew he would never see us again and acted accordingly.</p>
