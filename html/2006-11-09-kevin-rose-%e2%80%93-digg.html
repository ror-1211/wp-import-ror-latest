<p>Showing Digg swarm right now. The Rumsfield bubble grew huge within just a minute. Several thousand people use Swarm to watch Digg at any given time.</p>

<p>Digg is launching a Flash toolkit that will let users build their own tools for Digg.</p>

<p>How do they deal with users who are trying to game the system? They have one administrator responsible for everything. It took them a while to figure out all the different ways users were trying to game the system. They look at Digg patterns in the site. They watch stories as they are being dugg, and get a picture of what makes a healthy digg over time. This includes all the different places where diggs are coming from. The number of buries needed to remove a story depends on how robust the total diggs. They know when one user is digging over and over, keep track of ips, look for proxies.</p>

<p>They want to introduce others with the same interests. They look at what users have been digging and them match them up. They look for users who have a knack for finding what is new, what will be popular and what will be cool.</p>
