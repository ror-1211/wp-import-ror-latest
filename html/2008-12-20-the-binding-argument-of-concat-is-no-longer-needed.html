<p>If you upgrade to Rails 2.2.2 and start getting “The binding argument of #concat is no longer needed”  then wherever you do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
concat(content, block.binding)
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

change it to this:
<pre><code class="ruby">
concat(content)
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

The 'block.binding' argument is no longer needed which is nice because who really wanted to type that over and over again anyway.
</pre></pre>
