<p>When you are not especially mobile because you trashed your knee and you arenâ€™t supposed to bend it more than 30 degrees or else you might tear open a newly sewn together wound you appreciate the finer things in life.</p>

<p>My wife makes the best muffins in the world. Period. Every year, at least during the years when she can find apricots, she makes apricot jam. Said jam is then inserted into her home made muffin mix before baking. Something about the jam keeps it from turning into rock candy in the oven (like the other jams we have tried).</p>

<p>The result is a little bit of heaven in your mouth.</p>
