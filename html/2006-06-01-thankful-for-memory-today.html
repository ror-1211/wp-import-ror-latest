<p>On the way into work I was listening to ‘The Infinite Mind’ on NPR. It was a story about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179830/">Caris Corfman</a> an actress who lost her short term memory after surgery to remove a brain tumor. Her situation reminded me of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/"> 50 first dates</a>. At the time I saw the movie I had no idea that the condition was even possible, but today I am thankful for the simple ability to remember.</p>
