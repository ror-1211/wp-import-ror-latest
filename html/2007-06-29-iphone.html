<p>Yup, I got one. I was going to go mountain biking at lunch today, but instead I got suckered into going down to the local AT&amp;T store and waiting for 7 hours to get one of these babies.</p>

<p>They are cool.</p>

<p>The screen is sweet. The interface is slick. I love to browse through my albums. It is almost like the old Juke boxes you could find in burger joints. For my next trick I need to find out how to import my contacts from my old phone.</p>

<p>As for waiting.</p>

<p>Today was quite productive. I, Dave Ray and David Wiley managed to brainstorm all kinds of ideas and we met with the Nepal group for a while. The meeting turned out to be really awesome. One of the guys is interested in and currently working on a GeoStories like idea that Marion was looking into about a year ago. More on that another time (like after it is built).</p>
