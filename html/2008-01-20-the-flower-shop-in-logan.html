<p>My brother and sister in law bought the <a href="http://loganflowershop.com" title="The Flower Shoppe">flower shop in Logan</a> (Utah). It is always scary to start up a new business even when you are buying an existing one. My brother is even learning how to build web pages (he is the ‘webmaster’). After all these years of me trying to convince him to learn to write code it takes his wife becoming a <a href="http://loganflowershop.com/aboutus.aspx" title="Katie the florist at the Flower Shop">florist</a> to convert him to the dark side. At any rate I know how stressful small business can be so I wish them the best of luck. They’ll need it.</p>

<p>The good news for me is that I have a cheap place buy roses and other flowers when I need to avoid divorce.</p>
