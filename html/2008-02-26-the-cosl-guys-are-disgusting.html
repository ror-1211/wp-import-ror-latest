<p>First there was the joke about <a href="http://neverbashfulwithbutter.blogspot.com/2007/12/experiments-in-deliciousness-bacon.html">bacon chocolate chip cookies</a>. Sure somebody did it and it was funny. Then Jeremy actually made them and brought them to game night and people ate them. Thinking about it makes me dry heave.</p>

<p>Now Tom brings us <a href="http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/mini_bacon_exotic_candy_bar/mini_exotic_candy_bars">Mini Mos (chocolate) bacon bars</a>. My stomach may never recover.</p>
