<p>Just playing with <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">Theplancollection.com</a> this morning and noticed a couple of new plans that I thought looked pretty cool so I am sharing:</p>

<p>This one looks like something youâ€™d see in New England. It is kind of a craftsman house plan and kind of a cape code house plan:</p>

<p>I thought this one was kind of cool as well:
