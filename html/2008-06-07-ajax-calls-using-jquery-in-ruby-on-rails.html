<p>jQuery is the hot javascript library and it is small and it is cooler than Prototype, the default library that comes with Ruby on Rails.  Ergo I plugged it in and pulled out everything else.  The ajax calls are very simple and look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
$.post("function_name",{ key:value } ,function(data)
{
  // do stuff with data
});
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

The problem is that you will start seeing 'ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken' and your ajax calls will fail.
