<p>I am working on a quick Facebook application for a company called Flat World Knowledge. Basically I have 4 days to build the application - it has to be done by Tuesday.
Because of the simplicity of deployment on Morph Exchange I decided to deploy the application on their platform. I don’t have time to setup a full Rails deployment environment.</p>

<p>One problem. Facebook applications require access to the Facebook API. I used <a href="http://rfacebook.rubyforge.org/">rfacebook</a> because that is the library I have used in the past and could quickly get the application done.
(<a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker</a> is another library worth looking at if you are building a Facebok Application). I deployed the application but it wouldn’t start. I did some checking and finally found their deployment log.
Turns out the Facebook gems are not installed. <a href="http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything">There is a way to package up your gems into your project</a>. (<a href="http://gemsonrails.rubyforge.org/">This site will help as well</a>.)
With the popularity of Facebook applications growing and the need for scalability on demand I would think that having the Facebook gems already in place would be a must for a platform like MorphExchange.
I submitted a ticket yesterday and haven’t heard back yet. Hopefully they are responsive. I deployed on Morph for the speed of deployment. The clock is ticking for me.</p>
