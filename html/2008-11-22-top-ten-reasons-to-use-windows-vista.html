<p>I have a mac. I love my mac. I run VMWare so that I can use Windows as needed like when I need to test Internet Explorer because apparently a lot of people out there are still using it. Who knew?</p>

<p>At any rate I have a free copy of Windows Vista Ultimate edition that I got for attending a Microsoft developer conference. I thought I would give it a go. You should too.</p>

<p>Here are my top ten reasons to use Windows Vista:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your blood pressure is to low and you are feeling adventurous</li>
  <li>You need a divorce so you install it on your wife’s computer</li>
  <li>You are the IT support guy at work and you want to get fired</li>
  <li>Life has lost all meaning</li>
  <li>You really associate with that nerdy guy on the Apple commercials</li>
  <li>You have way to much free time and you like to wait around for your computer to do really hard stuff like open your email</li>
  <li>You enjoy click on I agree, OK, Yes please allow, Yes please !@#$!@ allow the stupid program to open, access the internet, save a file, print, …</li>
  <li>Hey, its better than having bamboo shoots shoved under your finger nails.</li>
  <li>You are a usability engineer and you want to study how not to build the ui for an operating system</li>
  <li>You have not yet heard about the Mac.</li>
</ol>
