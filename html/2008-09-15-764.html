<p>For lack of a better place to put this right now I am posting the roadmap for the Ruby on Rails social network we are building here. There has been quite a lot of interest in the project and quite a bit of willingness to contribute for which I am grateful. There are some features on this list that are a bit out there and we might not every get to. The idea is to do a brain dump and collect feedback. If you have interest or ideas feel free to add comments.</p>

<p>The code is currently running on:
<a href="http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org">Teachers Without Borders</a>
<a href="http://yfh.enpraxis.net/?lang=yfh-en">Youth for Habitat (English, Turkish)</a></p>
