<p>I donâ€™t drink a lot of soda so when I do drink it it has to be good. A couple of years ago Coke came out with a flavor that I grew to love - Black Cherry Vanilla. I bought a couple of 12 packs and kept them in the basement. I drank the last one this weekend.</p>

<p>First the recession and now my last Black Cherry Vanilla Coke. When will the pain end?</p>
