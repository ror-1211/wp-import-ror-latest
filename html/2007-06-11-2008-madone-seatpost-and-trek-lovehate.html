<p><a href="http://forums.roadbikereview.com/showthread.php?t=97036&amp;highlight=2008 madone">Interesting discussion on the new 2008 Trek Madone seatpost</a>. Some people like it others hate it. There seem to be plenty of people that don’t like Trek just because they are a big company. Personally, I like them because they are a US company, make good bikes, and have a good warranty. Aside from smaller builders - <a href="http://www.calfeedesign.com/">Calfee</a>, <a href="http://www.crumptoncycles.com/">Crumpton</a>, and <a href="http://www.parleecycles.com/">Parlee</a>, Trek is the only company that builds their own bikes right here in the US. I don’t know where Trek gets their carbon. I would like to know that. <a href="http://www.time-sport.com/us/home.htm">Time actually makes their carbon from the fiber</a> (click on company and then Time Visit on the left hand side. Their site nav kinda sucks.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will keep finding stuff on the new Madone and post it until you all want to puke.</p>
