<p>I messed up my local install of MySQL (it’s a long story that involves me almost throwing a punch to my 30” monitor). I finally gave up, deleted everything MySQL related according to <a href="http://akrabat.com/computing/uninstalling-mysql-on-mac-os-x-leopard/">these notes</a> and then I used homebrew to do a clean install.</p>

<p>After the install I started getting this error:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)
</code></pre>

<p>I couldn’t figure out what was going on so I checked my logs in /usr/local/var/mysql (in that directory find a file that ends in .err). Here’s what I kept seeing over and over again:</p>

<pre><code>110705 14:33:20 [ERROR] /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.12/bin/mysqld: unknown variable 'default-character-set=utf8'
110705 14:33:20 [ERROR] Aborting
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out if you upgrade MySQL you’ll want to modify /etc/my.cnf. This line causes problems:</p>

<pre><code>default-character-set = utf8
</code></pre>

<p>Remove that and you should be good. For reference here’s what my ‘/etc/my.cnf’ file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=64M
collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci
init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'
character-set-server = utf8
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note be sure to change max_allowed_packet to something like 64M. I was trying to restore a large database and MySQL kept barfing with this error:
ERROR 2006 (HY000) at line 682: MySQL server has gone away</p>

<p>Turns out the default packet size is to small to restore all but the smallest databases.</p>
