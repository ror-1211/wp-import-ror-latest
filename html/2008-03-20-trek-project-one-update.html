<p><a href="http://trekroad.typepad.com/trekroad/2008/03/project-one-det.html">I just got a notification about the status of Trek’s Project One</a>. Even if there are a few kinks left to work out and even though the pricing isn’t on the site just yet I am thrilled that Trek decided to let us have a look at what they are planning. Praise to Trek for listening to their customers.</p>
