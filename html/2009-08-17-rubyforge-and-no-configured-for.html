<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/tree/master">jeweler</a> to setup a new gem. I followed the instructions provided, but started getting “  configured for “ when I tried to do release my gem with “rake rubyforge:release”. It turns out that the rubyforge gem doesn’t quite configure everything for you. I added the following to ~/.rubyforge/autoconfig.yml and it started working:</p>

<pre><code>processor_ids:
  IA64: 6000
  Any: 8000
  AMD-64: 1500
  PPC: 2000
  Sparc: 4000
  Other: 9999
  i386: 1000
  Alpha: 7000
  MIPS: 3000
  UltraSparc: 5000
</code></pre>
