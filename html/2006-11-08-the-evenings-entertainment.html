<p>I hear that at past Web 2.0 conferences dinner on the second night was left to the attendees. This year AOL provided dinner and entertainment in the form of <a href="http://www.loureed.org/00/index.html">Lou Reed</a>. I like music but I must admit that I had no idea who this guy was until I looked him up and found that site. I guess old rock and roll superstar and new web companies are meant to go together - somehow.</p>
