<p>Last week right before we left for Yellowstone I went out to work on the sprinklers for the garden. I threw on some flip flops because that was easy. While walking around I felt something go over my foot. I thought it was the grass brushing against me ( I don’t like to mow the lawn so it gets long sometimes ). When I looked down I discovered that we have a bit of wildlife living in the garden. A two foot long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garter_snake">garter snake</a> slithered off into the neighbor’s yard.</p>

<p>I thought it was gone.</p>

<p>I told my girls about it. Later when they were outside I heard then yelling about a snake. I figured they were making it up. They do that. Right before we left I went out to water the garden. There it was again.</p>

<p>I left it alone. They eat mice and bugs and stuff.</p>

<p>Today my wife almost stepped on it. According to Wikipedia they can have 50 offspring at a time.</p>

<p>Now the snake has to go.</p>
