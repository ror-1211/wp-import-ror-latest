<p>This problem may not be specific to rFacebook, but when I added acts_as_facebook_user to my user model and then made a call like:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
my_user.first_name
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

I would get an 500 internal server error.  I checked the log and saw this:
<i>CGI::Session::CookieStore::CookieOverflow</i>

I found that if I changed the app so that it uses db sessions everything started working.

Uncomment this line in environment.rb:
<pre><code class="ruby">
config.action_controller.session_store = :active_record_store
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

Make sure to add the session tables to your db by using the rake task and you should be good to go.  Note that I am running edge rails so keep that in mind if you use this advice.
