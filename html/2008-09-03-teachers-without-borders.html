<p>During the day and lately most of the night I work as a Fellow for Teachers Without Borders at Utah State University. (funded by Cisco).
What I actually do bores most people and causes my wife to roll her eyes and tune out anytime someone asks what I do.
Itâ€™s a long story and involves a lot of technical crap that few people like to hear.</p>

<p>For tonight I have a shorter explanation. You can see what I do. We are just polished up our latest
release of the <a href="http://connect.teacherswithoutborders.org">new Teachers Without Borders website</a>.</p>

<p>Teachers Without Borders is a global non-governmental organization (NGO) that helps build and mentor teacher leaders around the world.
The point of what we are building is to provide a place where those individuals can come together and interact and build up one another.
We are still in the early stages, so expect a great deal more from the project.</p>

<p>The code that powers our social network is written in Ruby on Rails and is open source and MIT licensed. You can get it here:</p>

<p>The name is a play off of the original project lovd-by-less that we forked. Thanks to all those that have contributed to that
project and made our life easier.</p>
