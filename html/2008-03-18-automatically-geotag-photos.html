<p>I know that adding GPS to cameras will add cost to the unit but it seems like the perfect marriage. With the GPS data embedded inside the exif data you won’t have to tag your vacation with ‘Yellowstone National Park’. Instead, your photos can show up on a Google map or be set for auto tagging based on coordinates. Personally, I would pay some bucks for this feature. We have 60,000 digital photos. Managing that much data is a bit tricky. If we could search by location it would make my wife very happy.</p>

<p><a href="http://chickenarmpits.blogspot.com/">Marion</a> has been <a href="http://ereigo.com/2008/03/04/the-next-big-thing/">focusing on connecting information to physical spaces</a> and recently wrote about <a href="http://ereigo.com/2008/03/18/geotagging/">geotagging specifically</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few devices that enable this functionality now:
<a href="http://www.dawntech.hk/di-GPS/n2.htm"> N2 di-GPS mini</a> for Nikon cameras. <a href="http://www.moosenewsblog.com/archives/2007/06/23/coolest-tool-ever-062307/">Here’s someone that has one and loves it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~earlyj/gpsphotolinker/">Oregon State created some free software that runs on the Mac </a>. It will take GPS data and sync it with your photos. Pretty cool.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.canon.jp/imaging/wft/wft-e2/manual/gps/index.html">Canon makes an add-on for their cameras that adds a usb port.</a> You connect your GPS to that and it will add GPS data to your photos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/13416/slr_camera_gps_system/">Here’s a GPS that will connect to the flash hot shoe</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6624293.html">Sony and a few others make a GPS device that you put in your pocket</a>. It constantly takes readings and then syncs with the time on your photos. (keep the time on the devices in sync!). I hear it isn’t especially accurate.</p>

<p>Someday I hope to see GPS built right into the camera. Until then we’ll hack solutions to make it happen.</p>
