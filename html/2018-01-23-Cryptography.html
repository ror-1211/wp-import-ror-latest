<p>I was trying to find a good resource for understanding the mathematics behind cryptography and came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYRxaDweTODWOgZmuHQ9XK8t5lvbnQRU-">Christof Paar's cryptography series on YouTube</a>. This is the best set of lectures on understanding the fundamentals of cryptography that I've found.
It's 24 hours of video spread across a semester of classes so it will take a while to work through them, but they are worth the time. He does a great job teaching the math and reason for the math. Christof has a companion book available on <a href="http://www.crypto-textbook.com/">crypto-textbook.com</a>.</p>
