<p><a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/5/29/jamis-and-marcel-at-mountainwest-rubyconf-2007">Jamis Buck blogged about the code review of Ozmozr</a> he and <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">Marcel</a> did at the Mountain West Ruby Conference. The presentation was our favorite because of the insight it gave into our code and I think we came away as better programmers for it. <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf2007.confreaks.com/session10.html">Here is the link to the presentation on Conference Freaks</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=187808">if you want the source code they reviewed you can find it on Source Forge</a>.</p>
