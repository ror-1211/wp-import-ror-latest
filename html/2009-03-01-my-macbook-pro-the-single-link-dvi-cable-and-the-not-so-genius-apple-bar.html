<p>I and Callie took the kids to Salt Lake a while back so they could go to the <a href="http://www.discoverygateway.org/">Children’s Museum</a> at the Gateway. They had a great time. At the end of the day we wandered around the area a bit and since there is an Apple store I dropped in to see if they could solve my problem.</p>

<p>I told my wife it would only be a few minutes. Several hours later a finally got to talk to some high school kid that knew how to turn on the Mac and crop a photo in Photoshop but other than that they were pretty worthless. At least the store looks cool.</p>

<p>My journey to the Apple store started when I switched my monitory input. I have a 24” Dell monitor and I plug my Macbook Pro into that. As long as I used my DVI to VGA adapter the Macbook Pro would automatically detect when the monitor was plugged in. I figured that since I used my Mac almost exclusively these days I would use the DVI input for the better picture. However, when I started plugging directly into the DVI cable the Macbook Pro no longer recognized when the monitor was plugged in or not plugged in. This is a minor annoyance, but it bugged me so I determined to find a solution which is how I ended up at the Apple store.</p>

<p>They were no help at all and wasted a lot of my time and my poor wife had to wander around the gateway with the kids while I waited (Of course they couldn’t let me leave the store and just call my cell. I had to sit there). Did I mentioned that my trip to the Apple store was a total waste?</p>

<p>I had guessed for a while that it might have something to do with the cable. I being cheap didn’t want to buy a new one (I know I should have borrowed one) to test. I just assumed that the Apple geeks would know whether or not a cable would matter. They didn’t.</p>

<p>It turns out the cable is the issue. So if you find that your Mac doesn’t automatically recognize the monitor check the cable. It won’t work with a single link DVI cable, but will work with a dual link DVI cable.</p>

<p>Here’s a single link DVI cable. You don’t want this one:

<p>Here’s a Dual link DVI cable. You do want this one:

<p>The only visible difference is the pin count. The Single link DVI doesn’t have the pins in the middle.</p>
