<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/04/29/first-real-ride-on-the-new-trek-madone-69/">Here’s my first ride and first review of my new 2008 Trek Madone 6.9</a></p>

<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://www.justinball.com/2007/06/06/2008-trek-madone/">my 2008 Trek Madone post</a> I have some prices.</p>

<p>I am sure the price will vary from shop to shop, but here’s what I found out:
Pro Series
6.9 $8399
6.5 $5829
5.5 $4180</p>

<p>Performance Series
6.9 $7700
6.5 $5830
5.5 $4180
5.2 $3520</p>

<p>A couple of the Trek shops might have a couple of these bikes in stock, but from the people I have talked to don’t expect to see the bikes enmass until the August-October time frame.</p>
