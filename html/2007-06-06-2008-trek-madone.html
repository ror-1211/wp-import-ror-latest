<p>I am writing Ruby code today and all of a sudden I need a fix for bike porn so I do my usual search for Time bikes, this time the Time VXS which is supposed to be a comfort bike. <a href="http://www.velogogo.com/BILF/TimeVXSParisRoubaixSpecialForTomBoonen">I end up at VeloGoGo</a> and read about a special VXS built for Tom Boonen. <a href="http://www.velogogo.com/BILF/2007TrekMadone">Then I notice 2008 Trek Madone: The Un-BILF</a> and think I have to read this. About an hour later I have made my way through the <a href="http://bicycledesign.blogspot.com/2007/06/2008-trek-madone.html">latest</a> <a href="http://www.spinopsys.com/archives/1039">news </a><a href="http://craig-hardie.blogspot.com/">on the</a> <a href="http://www.roadcyclinguk.com/news/article/mps/UAN/2312/v/1/sp/">2008</a><a href="http://bikehugger.com/2007/06/madone_as_art.htm">Trek</a> Madone and my lust is off the charts.

<p>I am sure there will be more. Trek is loved and hated. I want to know how it rides which means I have to find one to ride.</p>

<p>Trek is back on my short list. I love that they are made in the United States and better yet there is a local shop that sells them so I don’t have to drive an hour and a half. Now I just need to find someone willing to let me ride one.</p>
