<p>I sat in a meeting at the university today and listened to a sales pitch by an SEO company. We get calls at <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">The Plan Collection</a> for these all the time.</p>

<p>I need to setup one of these companies. They are usually run by a couple of jokers who know very little about SEO. In this case the jokers were looking for easy money. They wanted 10k for a ‘keyword analysis’ and 10k to optimize 10 pages. Holy Crap!</p>

<p>The ‘analysis’ involved a bunch of people at the university running around coming up with the ‘things they want to advertise’ - read keywords. Not sure what that leaves for the SEO company to do. I guess they can type it up. Makes them a pretty dang expensive secretary. They then wanted to charge to setup an adwords campaign - you know because Google makes that process so hard.</p>
