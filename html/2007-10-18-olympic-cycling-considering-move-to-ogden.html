<p><a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=1994785">There is an article on KSL indicating that USA Olympic cycling might move to Ogden (Utah).</a> <a href="http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/13531.0.html">Again on Velo news.</a> Given the strong community of cyclists in Utah and the fact that I love cycling this would be awesome.</p>

<p>I know what I will be praying for for the next month.</p>
