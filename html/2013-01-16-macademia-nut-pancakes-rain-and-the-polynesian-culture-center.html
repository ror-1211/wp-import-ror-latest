<p>I hear it rains a lot in Hawaii in the winter. However, we are favored by the gods (probably because of all the times we visited the Tiki Room at Disneyland), and so we only had one day of major rain. I guess Mondays are like that even in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The food at the Polynesan Cultural Center was mediocre, but the show is amazing. I’m not sure if the guys from the various islands come as pyromaniacs but they must leave that way. It’s inspiring to watch other people play with fire. I might have to buy a flaming baton. Sorry no pictures on this one - they forbid the taking of photos and you don’t want to mess with a group of guys who look like they’ve been chiseled from stone.</p>
