<p>On the way back from the Mountain West Ruby Conference we dropped by <a href="http://www.xocolate.com/">xocolate</a> in Salt Lake. They have a mole chocolate made with something that will set your mouth on fire. I bought a half a pound of chocolate and a half pound of peppermint bark. That stuff will be the death of me. I can eat pounds of it in a single sitting - I kid you not I ate more than a pound of it at a game night. Oddly, I didn’t get sick.</p>

<p>We just ordered <a href="http://rogerschocolates.com/">Roger’s Chocolates</a> for my father for his birthday. They aren’t cheap, but they are supposed to be amazing. The sweet part of buying chocolates for someone for a present is that they often share.</p>

<p>I love Chocolate.</p>
