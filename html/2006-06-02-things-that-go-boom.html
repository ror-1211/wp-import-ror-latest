<p>When I was a boy scout ( a long time ago) someone tried to heat a can of beany weenies in the fire. In the infinite wisdom of a 13 year old they didn’t crack the lid. One explosion and a rain of beanie weenies later we were all ok. At another camp someone threw a can of mosquito spray in the fire. It took a while but it exploded with some fury and blew a hole in the shelter we had setup. We were stupid.<br />
I am just glad that we didn’t end up with the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=OW3WMZVTBOP45QFIQMGCFGGAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2006/06/01/ndeo01.xml">results of this British teen’s mistake.</a> Looks like an expensive mistake.</p>
