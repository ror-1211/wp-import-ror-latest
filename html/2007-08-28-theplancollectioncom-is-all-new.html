<p>For a year now I have been working on a new version <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">ThePlanCollection.com.</a> Last night at 2 am it finally went live. The new site is faster and easier to maintain. There are a few bugs still - Iâ€™ll have those fixed shortly. Look for new features and better ways to find house plans in the upcoming months.</p>
