<p>I do a little Wordpress work on my site using my Mac.  After upgrading to Snow Leopard I started getting errors like this:</p>

<p><i>
Warning: strtotime(): It is not safe to rely on the system’s timezone settings. You are <em>required</em> to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected ‘America/New_York’ for ‘EDT/-4.0/DST’ instead in /Users/scott/Sites/usic.net/wp-includes/functions.php on line 35
</i></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/308902">this post that talks about setting the time zone in Wordpress</a>.  Unfortunately, just setting a default time zone didn’t fix the problem  (it’s still a good idea though).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090831101932728">solution was to set a default time zone in my /etc/php.ini file</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="php">
date.timezone = "America/Boise"
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

You might not have a php.ini file in /etc.  If you don't then look for a file called 'php.ini.default' and copy that to php.ini.
