<p>My wife took the girls to Ogden today. While driving through the canyon the driver in front of here was driving erratic and she noticed that their hands moved a lot.
When she got to Brigham City she discovered that the people in the car in front of her were speaking in sign language. Something I had never thought about.</p>
