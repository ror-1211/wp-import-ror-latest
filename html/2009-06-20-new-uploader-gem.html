<p>I just pushed out a new uploader gem. <a href="http://github.com/jbasdf/uploader/tree/master">Get the new code from github</a> or install the gem with sudo gem install uploader. This comes with a few more translations and a fix for a nasty bug. The format was not properly set for uploads via swfupload. Unfortunately, even without the format it worked on uploads from my laptop, but not really for anyone else. I really hate that. At any rate itâ€™s fixed now.</p>
