<p>There is a lot of buzz on the BuddyPress mailing list now that there is a list. What is interesting and cool is that the group is interested in using standards like OAuth, Microformats and OpenID. This is great news. I think one of the great strengths of WordPress has been its hackability. It is easy to create themes, add plugins, etc. Adding support for simple standards means it will be easy to create mashups and loosely join with other platforms.</p>
