<p>I haven’t posted a lot lately. A lot of people with blogs say that and they suck because of it so I guess I suck too. Instead of being a radical nut job I am moving back into being a developer nut job. In addition to working on eduCommons at work I have been focusing on <a href="http://scrumdidilyumptio.us">scrumdidilyumptio.us</a>. If you want to know what it does click on the link. I think it’s cool. I am also gearing up to work on another interesting project that will gather data from all your favorite <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">blogs</a>/<a href="http://del.icio.us/">bookmark sites</a>/ and maybe even your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedcom">gedcom </a>data. It might just be cool. I have more or less quit playing Battlefield at night and have been focusing on a project I call ggugg. It will be an interesting way to manage your personal life. I think. I’ll post a link when its ready to go. Of course I am still working on <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">The Plan Collection</a>. <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">House plans</a> are still a hobby and something fun. So ya, I am like busy.</p>
