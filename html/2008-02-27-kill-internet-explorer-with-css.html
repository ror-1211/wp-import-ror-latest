<p>We got a call today at The Plan Collection that was interesting. A guy was trying to print out one of our pages. Each time he tried his browser would crash. At first I thought, “that is just nuts. Html can’t crash your browser.” Then Jake tried it and it crashed Internet Explorer. Then I tried it and sure enough whenever you try to print a page on <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">ThePlanCollection.com</a> your browser will crash.</p>

<p>I decide to investigate and sure enough Google comes through. <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2005/08/26/when-printing-kills/">Specific tags in your html code will cause Internet Explorer to crash when you try to print</a>.</p>

<p>That same website lists a couple of other <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/15/emreallyem-undoing-htmlcss/">nasty Internet</a> <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/16/when-browsers-attack/">Explorer bugs</a>. So yes you have to be careful when you write your html code. I would have never guessed that.</p>
