<p><a href="/2008/02/26/the-cosl-guys-are-disgusting/">My buddies at work find bacon chocolate chip cookies</a>. That is gross and disturbing. <a href="http://bakerella.blogspot.com/2008/01/grocery-item-turns-gourmet.html">My wife found a recipe for truffles made with Oreos mixed with cream cheese and coated with white chocolate</a>. This represents everything that is wrong and right with our society all at once.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re going to make some for game night.</p>
