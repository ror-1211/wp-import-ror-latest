<p>I don’t mean to be to big of 2008 Madone fan boy, but it is a sexy bike and my lust is driving me ever closer to droping the 6-8k required to put one of these under my butt (For the 6.9 of course). My only hesitation is that I might not get one until September or later. This would suck as one of the purposes of a new bike is to train for <a href="http://www.lotojaclassic.com/MainPage.html">Lotoja</a> and to have a decent bike to ride the 206 miles.</p>

<p>So….</p>

<p>I am headed to the bike shop tomorrow to see if I can get my order in. I doubt it would be here in time for my next <a href="http://bikeutu.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BIKE_UTU_homepage">century</a>, but I am hoping to see one before the end of the summer.</p>

<p>In the mean time read more about the new 08 Madone:
