<p>I’ve let this blog sit idle for a very long time because all the cool kids stopped blogging and I’ve spent so much time on the tech that I neglected writing anything.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to change that now. My initial experience with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" title="gatsby.js">Gatsby</a> wasn’t good. I don’t have a lot of time and so getting everything setup took forever. In spite of the effort I knew that I wanted a static site. I used to use <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. It’s painfully slow to load. Keeping up with security updates was a nightmare and the allure of hosting content on S3 for a few pennies a month was just too great. Given that pain I’ve gone through a couple of site generators. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was technology of choice for a long time. I write a lot of Ruby code so it was a natural fit. However it was slow. I’ve been enjoying learning and playing around with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> so I considered <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It’s really fast, but I really wanted to be able to customize my code a bit via Javascript so Gatsby won. I guess that’s a lot about technology right after I said I was going to spend more time writing and less time on tech.</p>

<p>Given how much pain I went through to get everything setup I was dreading the Gatsby 2.0 upgrade. Turns out it wasn’t bad. I spent about 3 hours changing some code, upgrading packages and thinking about how to proceed going forward.</p>

<p>Ironically, part of that process included considering a move to Hugo and dumping Gatsby. While looking through Hugo templates I discovered <a href="https://forestry.io/">forestry.io</a>. I sit at a computer all day and so opening my site, writing and post and doing a deploy isn’t a big deal. However, I really wanted to be able to make a post on the web, have it commit to <a href="https://github.com/jbasdf/justinball" title="Justin Ball">my github repo</a>, and have it auto deploy to my site. I started down the path of writing the code to make that happen multiple times, but life and work and a million things meant I never had time to finish it. <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> solves that exact problem.</p>

<p>Now I can stop writing code I’ll never finish and focus on writing posts that no one will read :).</p>
