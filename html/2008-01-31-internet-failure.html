<p>By total chance I found <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/31/dubai.outage/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">this article about the internet failing in two continents</a>.  This hurts the economy of several Middle Eastern and African countries which sucks.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#History">Wasn’t the point of the internet to create a distributed communications network that could withstand a nuclear war?</a> What happened?</p>
