<p>Tonight riding with the Logan Race Club up Blacksmith Fork Canyon I crossed 4000 miles so far for the year. Thanks to Shawn Collins and <a href="http://www.affiliatesummit.com/">Affiliate Summit</a> that’s $4000 towards breast cancer research.</p>

<p>I love to ride, but each time I ride there’s the added motivation that every mile is another dollar towards a cure.</p>
