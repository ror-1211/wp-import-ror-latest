<p>I’ve been to a good number of conferences over the years. A lot of them cost a lot of money. If you are a geek and a ruby lover (who isn’t?) then the best event you’ll ever attend is the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/">Mountain West Ruby conference</a>. <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/schedule">The schedule is up</a>.</p>

<p>It’s only a hundred bucks and the best of the best show up. <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.eventwax.com/mountainwest-rubyconf-2009/register">Get registered now</a> so you don’t hate yourself in the morning.</p>
