<p>Just ran into this:</p>

<p>I guess after <a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/09/08/why-cyclists-shave-their-legs-the-most-disgusting-post-i-will-ever-make/">hitting a rattle snake on the bike</a> you start to see all the other awful things you can hit on a bike. Glad to hear this guy was OK. A few years ago during Lotoja a guy hit a deer coming down one of the mountain passes. He was beaten up pretty badly. You really have to watch out for everything on the road.</p>
