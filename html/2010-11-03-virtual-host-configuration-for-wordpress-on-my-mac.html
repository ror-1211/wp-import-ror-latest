<p>I mainly post this so I don’t forget, but someone else might find it useful. I always forget how to configuration the virtual host on my local Apache so that WordPress will run right. (I don’t like to use MAMP - don’t ask why). Note that ‘jbasdf’ is my username. Use your username in place of ‘jbasdf’.</p>

<p><a href="http://shapeshed.com/journal/setting_up_local_websites_on_snow_leopard/">See this article to find out more about setting up virtual hosts on your local machine</a>. The file ‘/etc/apache/users/jbasdf.conf’ is automatically included in your apache config because of this line in httpd.conf:</p>

<pre><code>Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Edit /etc/apache/users/jbasdf.conf:</p>

<pre><code>    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all


    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

NameVirtualHost *:80

  DocumentRoot /Users/jbasdf/projects/wordpress_sites/justinball
  ServerName justinball.dev
  ServerAlias www.justinball.dev
  ErrorLog /Users/jbasdf/projects/wordpress_sites/justinball/logs/error_log
  CustomLog /Users/jbasdf/projects/wordpress_sites/justinball/logs/access_log common
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that if you do this you’ll want to change ‘etc/hosts’ so that your Mac will send requests to localhost:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1 justinball.dev
127.0.0.1 www.justinball.dev
</code></pre>
