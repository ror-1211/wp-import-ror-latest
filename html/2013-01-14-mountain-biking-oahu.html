<p>Friday I managed to get some mountain biking in. Years ago I read about mountain biking in Hawaii and how awesome it was. It is awesome, but I don’t remember reading about getting an ass kicking in the article. Oahu is beautiful and the mountain biking was a fun challenge, but tree roots and mud make up a lot of the trail. If you venture into the rain forest here be ready for plenty of both. I tried the <a href="http://www.mtbhawaii.com/trails/west_kaunala_trail">West Kaunala Trail</a>. I’m not a hard core mountain biker so I found this ride a fun challenge with plenty of hike a bike sections over tree roots and through some nasty mud. A more skilled rider could probably ride more. I’d love to watch someone with skills climb the sections with nasty roots.</p>

<p>Some pictures:</p>

<p>There’s a very idyllic ranch on the way up.</p>

<p>The jeep road is wide and makes for an easy/fun ride</p>

<p>I think I rode the route opposite of what was recommended. Here’s where I started.</p>

<p>Plenty of muck and mud to plow through.</p>

<p>More mud. It was a theme.</p>

<p>This was cool. Nice of the trees to not block the trail.</p>

<p>There are 4 creek crossings.</p>

<p>This is where the killer trees on Lord of the Rings came from.</p>

<p>The view is the reward for the climb. That’s the North Shore of Oahu.</p>

<p>After mountain biking I managed to get in a bit of a road ride back to Turtle Bay to meet everyone else. The roads on Oahu aren’t my favorite places to ride. There’s a constant stream of traffic and I moved off the road a couple of times. The saving grace was the fruit stands along the side of the road. The nice old lady who sold me pineapple and papaya laughed pretty hard when I tried to stuff everything into my tiny Camelback. I nearly dropped the pineapple so I ended up carrying all the groceries on the handlebars - XTR/Sram 29er turned into grocery hauler.</p>

<p>We ended the night helping Judy make it home from Haleiwa Joes:</p>

<p>Actually we ended the night this way:</p>
