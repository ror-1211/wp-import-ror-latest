<p>For the project we are working on for Teachers Without Borders we need a reliable asynchronous way to process tasks. There are a myriad of ways to do this and if you aren’t careful you’ll spend weeks second guessing yourself while investigate every possible option. Not that I would know that from experience.</p>

<p>We chose <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/">Starling</a> and Workling as our solution. Starling is a message queue that uses memcache. It was <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/2008/01/announcing-starling.html">built by the guys at Twitter</a> and <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/01/twitters-starling-released-as-open.html">released as open source</a>. I bet it scales.</p>

<p><a href="http://playtype.net/past/2008/2/6/starling_and_asynchrous_tasks_in_ruby_on_rails/">Workling</a> is a great plugin built by a couple of guys working on <a href="http://boomloop.com">boomloop.com</a> It makes using Starling a bit easier especially when it comes to consuming messages from the queue.</p>

<p>There are a few blog posts around that describe how to get stuff up and running. Other than that the documentation is a bit sparse. I have to believe that will change over time. I am throwing my own links and experience into the mix so I don’t forget how to do this.</p>

<p>First get the gems you need to run starling:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
sudo gem install starling
sudo gem install memcache-client
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

Get the [working plugin][6]
<pre><code class="ruby">
git clone http://github.com/purzelrakete/workling/tree/master/Changes
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>

 [6]: http://github.com/purzelrakete/workling/tree/master/Changes

<pre><code class="ruby">
# Get starling and working going with:
#
# Fire up starling - this isn't in daemon mode. Add a -d for that.
# starling -P tmp/pids/starling.pid -q tmp/starling
#
# Next fire up the server
# script/server
#
# Get workling going
# script/workling\_starling\_client start
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>
