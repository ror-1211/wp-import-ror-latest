<p>Not long ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/02/22/mozycom-and-their-backup-software-is-shit/">rather unflattering review of Mozy</a>. I feel bad in a way because I still believe that the concept is good. I haven’t played with the software recently but I am guessing that my voice was loud enough to influence significant change.</p>

<p>I am fine with that.</p>

<p>There are a number of other companies that offer similar services. However, at the end of the day I think the simple solution is the one I will go with. In fact I went with it. It took me 15 minutes to setup one night and it now costs me literally pennies to backup my data.</p>

<p>Step One:
<a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/index.aspx">Download Jungle Disk</a>. This nice little app makes it simple to send files to S3 and it is cheap - $20.</p>

<p>Step Two:
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Get a key from Amazon</a>. They’ll want your credit card.</p>

<p>Step Three:
Tell jungle disk to automatically backup specific files to amazon.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that Jungle Disk is easy to use and will walk you through getting a key and setting up your backups. It also won’t fill your temp drive with random crap.</p>
