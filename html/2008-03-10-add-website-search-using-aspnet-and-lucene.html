<p>I have read a lot about <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene</a> over the years and finally managed to find an excuse to play with it. I used it to add a general search to <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com">ThePlanCollection.com</a>. <a href="http://www.theplancollection.com/house-plan-related-articles/search-using-asp-net-and-Lucene">Hereâ€™s a detailed writeup including the code I used to implement search using Lucene on ASP.Net</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
