<p>There are some interesting changes happening at Amazon.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VJ7I8/104-9757223-1894316?v=glance&amp;n=172282&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance">Pick a product and look close</a>. 
You will see two new features.  One is the addition of tags. 
You can now add a tag to a product.  As you do you will be
prompted with tags that others have used.  After you tag it, you
can click on the tag and see other products that have the same
tag.  The second big feature is the addition of a customer
wiki.  Customers can modify one of the product descriptions. 
Very interesting.</p>
