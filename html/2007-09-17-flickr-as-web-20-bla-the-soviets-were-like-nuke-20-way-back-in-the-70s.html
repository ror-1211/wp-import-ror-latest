<p>I watched Dr Strangelove late at night a couple of weeks ago. It is dark humor and a movie in classical Kubrick style. The irony in the movie has so much to teach modern society. In a sick twist of fiction meeting fact we have to learn to love the bomb all over again. <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/soviet-doomsday.html">There is a good chance Soviets really did build a dooms day device back in the 70s, turned it on in 1985 and it is still running.</a></p>

<p>Nuclear weapons are never funny. OK maybe sometimes they are. Web 2.0 has brought us new and interesting names - names like flickr. I bet they though they were being new and crazy. Guess what. The Soviets have been dropping e’s way before the Silicon Valley crowd.</p>

<p>Notice the code name of the device <strong><em>“Perimetr”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>At least if it goes off humanity won’t have died from those old 1.0 weapons. No way baby this is Nuke 2.0.</p>
