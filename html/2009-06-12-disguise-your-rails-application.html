<p>I spent quite a while trying to figure out how to theme my Ruby on Rails applications.  Turns out after you build a piece of software people want to use it to do other stuff.  Go figure.</p>

<p>I really like how simple it is to skin a Wordpress site so I <del datetime="2009-06-07T05:49:50+00:00">stole</del> borrowed some ideas.</p>

<p>From all of my research and effort and late night I give you disguise the ruby gem that makes it simple to skin your Rails application and impress everyone (ok maybe your mom).</p>

<p>Disguise makes it possible to generate a theme for your Rails website, set the current ‘theme’ using an admin interface or change the theme based on the current url.</p>

<p>Install the gem:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
  sudo gem install disguise
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>
