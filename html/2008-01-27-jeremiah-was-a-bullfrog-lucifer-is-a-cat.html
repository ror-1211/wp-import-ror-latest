<p>Whether I like it or not my daughters are big fans of the Disney princess world.</p>

<p>I am realizing that most things around here are whether I like it or not.</p>

<p>Anyway, the have seen Cinderella 1, 2 and 3 multiple times. Tonight they were telling I and Callie that they learned about Lucifer today in sunday school. I am sure there teachers enjoyed arguing with them. Lucifer is the cat in Cinderella not the devil.</p>

<p>Tonight at dinner they were chanting Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer - kind of freaky - then was a cat.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think TV has any influence on kids at all.</p>
