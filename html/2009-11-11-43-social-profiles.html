<p>One challenge any community site faces is how to let users express themselves. It is hard to express the sum total of any individual on a web page, but in the virtual world that interface is the one chance a user has to connect with another human being. The challenge for designers is making the profile look good. In most instances the profiles end up cluttered and in the MySpace instance where users are allowed to customize the look of their profile the site ends up with some of the ugliest pages ever created. However, Iâ€™m not convinced that is a fault in their system. If you look at most teenagers rooms they would likely qualify as a superfund cleanup site. Their online profiles reflect that.</p>

<p>The following is a list of profiles from all types of social networks. Some are general networks like Facebook. Others are niche networks like <a href="http://www.bakespace.com">Bakespace</a>. One thing I find interesting is how each niche site tries to let the user express themselves in a way that is unique to the site. For example, <a href="http://www.genlighten.com">Genlighten</a> has a genealogy slant and the profile reflects the users actions in that space. That is a critical feature for any site that has a particular focus else why not just use our <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> (or other similar network) as our global profile on every site. The unique attributes like recipes or genealogy societies are key to success for focused networks. The images do a much better job conveying the message from each site so have a good time looking through them. Look for a future post on how networks help with user discovery and search.</p>

    <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> Let's each user add a personal blurb and then lists the user's claimed blogs. You'll also see a list of tags related to the topics generated by the user which makes sense since Technorati is all about the blogs your produce.

    <a href="http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org">Teachers Without Borders</a> I have to take responsibility for this design. The focus is on user activity with boxes of stuff like documents, colleagues, groups, etc on the side. Since I built it the original intent was to help teachers connect with one another using the content they produce.

    <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> has to have the largest concentration of ugly found anywhere on the internet. I took a shot of my profile which has nothing in it because it was easier then trying to find a profile that I could comfortably post on my blog. I give them credit because users love the chance to create ugly but MySpace feels like the ultimate internet ghetto.

  <div class="post-images">
    <a href="http://www.mixx.com">Mixx</a> is about sharing links and so the profile shows that. It also includes links to friends. Interestingly enough Mixx also has a 'Trophy Case'. Here they are trying to encourage user behavior with achievements. I'd actually love to know how well that works.

    <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">Livejournal</a> has a profile system for their users. The focus of the system is on blogs not on the profiles so I'm guessing not a lot of users find their way here. The profiles aren't pretty but they do provide a fair amount of information about the blog posts the user is generating.

  <div class="post-images">
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> has a great deal more information than most networking sites probably because it's professional intent. Your profile here reflects your career and is basically a dynamic resume.
